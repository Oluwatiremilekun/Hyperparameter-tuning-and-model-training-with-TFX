# Hyperparameter-tuning-and-model-training-with-TFX
In this lab, you will be again doing hyperparameter tuning but this time, it will be within a Tensorflow Extended (TFX) pipeline.  We have already introduced some TFX components in Course 2 of this specialization related to data ingestion, validation, and transformation.
